# PackageTracker
A simple package tracker for android (Poland only)

This application is a uni project for my lab.

It tracks packages provided by courier in the app.

A server is required that's running on python. It requires PhantomJS and Flask.

Google maps api is required in: app/res/values/google_maps_api.xml

Added package numbers are stored on the device
